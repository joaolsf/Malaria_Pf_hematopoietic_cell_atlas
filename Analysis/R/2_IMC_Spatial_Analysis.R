#4- Spatial Community Analysis

#The detection of spatial communities was proposed by (Jackson et al. 2020). 
#Here, cells are clustered solely based on their interactions as defined by the spatial object graph. 
#In the following example, we perform spatial community detection separately for tumor and stromal cells.

#The general procedure is as follows:
#1. create a colData(spe) entry that specifies if a cell is part of the tumor or stroma compartment. 
#2. use the detectCommunity function of the imcRtools package to cluster cells within the tumor or stroma compartment solely based on their spatial interaction graph as constructed by the steinbock package.
#Both tumor and stromal spatial communities are stored in the colData of the SpatialExperiment object under the spatial_community identifier.
#We set the seed argument within the SerialParam function for reproducibility purposes. 
#This is important as the global seed is not recognized by functions provided by the BiocParallel package.

#5- Cellular neighborhood analysis

#The following section highlights the use of the imcRtools package to detect cellular neighborhoods. 
#This approach has been proposed by (Goltsev et al. 2018) and (Schürch et al. 2020) to group cells based on information contained in their direct neighborhood.
#(Goltsev et al. 2018) perfomed Delaunay triangulation-based graph construction, neighborhood aggregation and then clustered cells.
#(Schürch et al. 2020) on the other hand constructed a 10-nearest neighbor graph before aggregating information across neighboring cells.
#In the following code chunk we will use the 20-nearest neighbor graph as constructed above to define the direct cellular neighborhood. 
#The aggregateNeighbors function allows neighborhood aggregation in 2 different ways:

#A- For each cell the function computes the fraction of cells of a certain type (e.g., cell type) among its neighbors.
#B- For each cell it aggregates (e.g., mean) the expression counts across all neighboring cells.

#Based on these measures, cells can now be clustered into cellular neighborhoods. 
#We will first compute the fraction of the different cell types among the 20-nearest neighbors and use kmeans clustering to group cells into 6 cellular neighborhoods.

#6- lisaClust
#An alternative to the aggregateNeighbors function is provided by the lisaClust Bioconductor package (Patrick et al. 2021).

#More precise, the package summarizes L-functions from a Poisson point process model to derive numeric vectors 
#for each cell which can then again be clustered using kmeans.

#The lisa function requires a SegmentedCells object which can be generated using the spicyR package.

#7- Spatial Context Analysis

#Downstream of CN assignments, we will analyze the spatial context (SC) of each cell using three functions from imcRtools.
#While CNs can represent sites of unique local processes, the term SC was coined by Bhate and colleagues (Bhate et al. 2022) 
#and describes tissue regions in which distinct CNs may be interacting. 
#Hence, SCs may be interesting regions of specialized biological events.

#Here, we will first detect SCs using the detectSpatialContext function. 
#This function relies on CN fractions for each cell in a spatial interaction graph (originally a KNN graph),
#which we will calculate using buildSpatialGraph and aggregateNeighbors. 
#We will focus on the CNs derived from cell type fractions but other CN assignments are possible.

#Of note, the window size (k for KNN) for buildSpatialGraph should reflect a length scale 
#on which biological signals can be exchanged and depends, among others, on cell density and tissue area. 
#In view of their divergent functionality, we recommend to use a larger window size for SC (interaction between local processes) than for CN (local processes) detection. 
#Since we used a 20-nearest neighbor graph for CN assignment, we will use a 40-nearest neighbor graph for SC detection. 
#As before, different parameters should be tested.
#Subsequently, the CN fractions are sorted from high-to-low and the SC of each cell is assigned as the minimal combination of SCs that additively surpass a user-defined threshold. 
#The default threshold of 0.9 aims to represent the dominant CNs, hence the most prevalent signals, in a given window.
#For more details and biological validation, please refer to (Bhate et al. 2022).

#B- Components which contain less than 10 cells are excluded.
#C- Expand the components by 1µm to construct a concave hull around the patch and include cells within the patch.

#9- Interaction analysis

#The next section focuses on statistically testing the pairwise interaction between all cell types of the dataset. 
#For this, the imcRtools package provides the testInteractions function which implements the interaction testing strategy proposed by (Schapiro et al. 2017).
#Per grouping level (e.g., image), the testInteractions function computes the averaged cell type/cell type interaction count 
#and computes this count against an empirical null distribution which is generated by permuting all cell labels (while maintaining the tissue structure).
#In the following example, we use the steinbock generated spatial interaction graph and estimate the interaction or avoidance between cell types in the dataset.

#These results are comparable to the interaction testing presented above.

#while this interaction is not as strong when considering CD4 T cells sitting around myeloid cells.
