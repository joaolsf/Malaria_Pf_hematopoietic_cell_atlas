# When saving the project as a .RDS or .Rdata, these pointers are broken and can produce errors when loaded again.
# saveGiotto() is a function that can save Giotto Suite projects into a contained structured directory that can then be properly loaded again later using loadGiotto().

# and a giottoPolygon object for the ‘cell’ spatial unit in the spatial_info slot.
# This function performs the manual object creation steps described below.
# To skip those steps and preliminary data exploration, go to Section 5.

# ‘subcellular’ - loads and requires subcellular information from tx_file and fov_positions_file only.
# ‘aggregate’ - loads and requires the existing aggregate information (expression, spatial locations, and metadata) from exprMat_file and metadata_file.

# [Images] Images in the default CellComposite, CellLabels, CompartmentLabels, and CellOverlay folders will be loaded as giotto largeImage objects in all workflows as long as they are available. 
# Additionally, CellComposite images will be converted to giotto image objects, making plotting with these image objects more responsive when accessing them from a server.

# and then including the subcellular information as secondary data.

# the subcellular data and all data generated from it should be given the spatial unit 'cell' 
# and the pre-generated aggregated information should be given a different spatial unit such as 'cell_agg' to differentiate between the two sources of information.

# In this step, we will be aggregating the feature points of 'rna' and 'neg_probe' into the 'cell' spatial unit.

# 7. Filtering and normalization

# After the expression matrix is generated from the subcellular information, analysis proceeds through data filtering and normalization.
# For the normalization step, we will employ two types.

# A- standard normalization method: library size normalization and log normalization. 
# This method will produce both normalized and scaled values that are be returned as the ‘normalized’ and ‘scaled’ expression matrices respectively. 
# In this tutorial, the normalized values will be used for generating expression statistics and plotting expression values. 
# The scaled values will be ignored. We will also generate normalized values for the negative probes for visualization purposes during which the library normalization step will be skipped.

# B- pearson residuals: A normalization that uses the method described in Lause/Kobak et al. 2021. 
# This produces a set of values that are most similar in utility to a scaled matrix and offer improvements to both HVF detection and PCA generation. 
# These values should not be used for statistics, plotting of expression values, or differential expression analysis.
